                    An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or
                    demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a
                    practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the term is also often used in the entertainment
                    business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A studio is an artist or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose
                of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking,
                photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production
                broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified
                to dance studio.
                The word studio is derived from the Italian: studio, from Latin: studium, from studere, meaning to study
                or zeal.

                The French term for studio, atelier, in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to
                characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an
                alchemist or wizard.

                The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the
                assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the workshop of..." or "studio of..." An art
                studio is sometimes called an atelier, especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language
                use, "atelier" can also refer to the Atelier Method, a training method for artists that usually takes
                place in a professional artist's studio. The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production
                which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who
                occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to
                design, ranging from architecture to product design. In specific, educational studios are studio
                settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.
                Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are krypl for staying up
                late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.Artists or writers, predominantly those
                producing comics, still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a comic strip, comic
                book or graphic novel. In the early days of Dan Dare, Frank Hampson employed a number of staff at his
                studio to help with the production of the strip.</p>
